# Competency v1

## Introduction  

This page shows you how to access our Domains of Competency Index. A Domain of Competency \(DomComp for short\) is a general term used to refers to a topic, skill, domain of knowledge or occupation associated to a learning object. The main objective of a DomComp is to make it easier for learners to find educational content related to their objective or interest, whatever the way they formulate it.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This API is currently in public beta. As such, it is available for free until we launch it commercially. Feel free to email us at [sales@inokufu.com](mailto:sales@inokufu.com) if you have any questions.
{% endhint %}

## Background

While building the Learning Objects Index, we faced tremendous challenges classifying the various skills, occupations or domains of knowledge that each learning object can be associated with. A lot of frameworks and taxonomies have tried to map this. Wikipedia is one of the most know and used. In Europe, there is the [ESCO](https://ec.europa.eu/esco/portal/home?resetLanguage=true&newLanguage=en) which is the multilingual classification of European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations. In France, there are similar frameworks such as [ROME](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/repertoire-operationnel-des-metiers-et-des-emplois-rome/) or [Formacode](https://formacode.centre-inffo.fr/). And many more in each country or industry. But none is perfect or really universal.

Knowing that we couldn't build one single taxonomy that would work for every learner, we decided to take another approach. Instead of creating a new taxonomy or framework, we decided to build the Domains of Competency Index \(DCI\) to bring them all and in the lightness bind them. As a result, Inokufu DCI is a sort of meta index that can be connected to any existing skill/occupation/domain taxonomies or frameworks. Using Machine Learning and Graph Theory, Inokufu DCI binds these sources together and makes it easier for edtech companies to build the next generation of learning tools.

**We built the Competency API as the easiest way to interact skills/occupations/domains of knowledge from one single API.**

## Authentication

Inokufu APIs expects for the API key to be included in API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Shell" %}
```bash
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "x-api-key: SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER"
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Python" %}
```python
import requests
url = 'api_endpoint_here'
headers = {'x-api-key': 'SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER'}
r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
r.json()
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="PHP" %}
```php
$key = 'SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER';
$curl = curl_init('api_endpoint_here');
curl_setopt($curl,CURLOPT_CAINFO,__DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'certInokufu.cer');
curl_setopt($curl, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, array('x-api-key:'.$key));
$data = curl_exec($curl);
if($data===false){
    var_dump(curl_error($curl));
};
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Javascript" %}
```javascript
apiKeySecured = 'SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER';
const search = async () => {fetch('api_endpoint_here', {headers: {"x-api-key": apiKeySecured}} ).then(function(response) {
  if(response.ok) {
      response.json().then(function(json) { 
        const resJson = JSON.stringify(json)
        //console.log(resJson);
        return resJson;
})}})};
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure to replace SAY-FRIEND-AND-ENTER with the demo key or with your own Developer API key.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
For Demo purpose, you can use this API key : `MzSXmgX5Tl8HSZNIyXcElaL69MtOXymj1stHS4Jt` but beware both request speed and number of daily calls are limited with this key.
{% endhint %}

### Usage plans

{% hint style="danger" %}
For now, the API is available for free using the demo key above. This is a demo key and thus the API is throttled. If you want higher usage quota, email us at [sales@inokufu.com](mailto:sales@inokufu.com) and we will provide you with your own Developer API key.
{% endhint %}

If you have specific requirement for your use case, we can offer you a tailored usage plan. If you want to know more about our enterprise plans, please feel free to contact our [Inokufu sales team](mailto:contact@inokufu.com?subject=Inokufu%20API%20Key%20request&body=Hi,%0D%0A%20%0D%0A%20I%20found%20your%20awesome%20Inokufu%20API%20Cloud%20and%20I%20would%20be%20very%20intersted%20to%20get%20a%20Key!%0D%0A%20%0D%0A%20My%20name%20is%20....%20and%20I%27d%20like%20to%20get%20a%20free%20API%20key%20for%20testing%20purpose%20/%20paid%20API%20key%20for%20integrating%20it%20in%20my%20app/project.%20%0D%0A%20%0D%0A%20Regards,%20%0D%0A%20...). 

{% hint style="info" %}
We also have an academic access program for researchers and academics that would like to build and experiment with this API. 
{% endhint %}

## Best efforts

Our mission is to help you find the best learning objects out there. While we are working hard on this ambitious goal, we are still at the beginning of this journey, and we have not connected every existing skill/occupation/domain \(yet\). At this stage, we can't guaranty 100% accuracy of our results. 

**Results returned by the API are our best efforts to match your query.**

Most endpoints of the Competency API returns a `score` that gives you an indication of the confidence level of the corresponding result. The higher the score, the more confident.

Responses returned by endpoint `suggest` also contains a message \(`msg`\) that tells you how good we think our answer to your query is. Messages currently returned by the API are shown in the table below.

| Code | Message | Meaning |
| :--- | :---: | :---: |
| A00 |  These results are our best effort to answer your query. | We are pretty confident that these results closely match what you are looking for.    |
| B00 | These results does not match exactly your query. | We have some results to show you that may be close enough to your query but still it's not exactly what you asked for, so you know. |
| C00 | No result to display for this query. | We have found no result we are confident enough to show you based on what you are looking for. Try again with less strict parameters. |

{% hint style="info" %}
Depending on the level of accuracy you need, you may want to filter out reponses based on the code returned in`msg.`
{% endhint %}

## Suggest

This endpoint returns a list of suggestion of skill, occupation or domain of knowledge for specific keywords. This endpoint is not to be confused with the endpoint `/similar` which acts more as a synonym search within various finite taxonomies/frameworks. The endpoint `/suggest` is designed to make features such as autocomplete search input or suggested query. This endpoint is not limited by any taxonomy/framework.
