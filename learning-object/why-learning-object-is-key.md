# Why learning object is key

For centuries, the main educational resources were written texts on tablet, manuscript or books. In our digital age, educational resources are readily available under many types, whether physical or digital.&#x20;

In the early 2000, the concept of learning object emerged. \
[Learning objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning\_object\_metadata) (LO) are defined as any entity, digital or non-digital, that may be used for learning, education or training. So basically, it could be any object that help learner achieve one or more learning goals.

This board definition is necessary because education is changing tremendously with both the demographical and technological changes. New types of LO have recently appeared such as MOOCs or podcasts and new one will undoubtedly be created with the rise of Virtual reality and Metaverse.

Up to now, education was focused on scalability, i.e. how to provide satisfactory education at large scale. Going forward, education is aiming at providing a more personalised learning experience to each learner (e.g. adaptive learning).

The education is thus facing a paradox: how to deliver large scale education (i.e. standard learning pathway), while personalising the learning pathway to each learner.&#x20;

Learning object is a key part of the solution addressing this paradox: by breaking down the learning pathway in elementary objects, we can offer many different pathway, leading to the same learning goals.&#x20;

This shift is related to what is called the **Competency-based education** vs **Traditional education** systems.
