# Popularity note

This is a number from -1 to 1 that indicates how popular the learning object is.

The popularity note is generated automatically from -1 to 0.79 by our algorithms based on the popularity data we collected for the learning object. The nature and availability of the popularity data differ from one provider to another: likes and views for YouTube videos, enrollment and 5-star reviews for MOOCs, comments, reviews, etc

As a result our algorithms normalized these popularity data in two steps: first compared to all the learning objects of the same provider and then compared to all learning objects in our index. This ends up in a value comprised between -1 and 0.79. Some exceptional learning object have a popularity note above 0.8. A value above 0.8 can only be awarded by one of our human Pedagogical Auditor.

Please note that Inokufu Index of Learning Object only keeps learning object with a popularity note above 0.

For the time being, popularity is used as a rough indicator for the quality of LO.

Here is a guideline to set the popularity value:&#x20;

* 0 LO unknown quality&#x20;
* 0.01 to 0.49 good LO&#x20;
* 0.50 to 0.79 very good LO&#x20;
* 0.80 to 0.89 stunning LO&#x20;
* 0.90 to 1 best LO for this topic
