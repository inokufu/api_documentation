# Age

### Age (min)

This is the minimum age for which the learning object would be useful in general. It is usually combined with Age (max) to set the higher age threshold.

For example if a YouTube video is about "color" for helping toddlers learn the name of the color, age (max) would probably set to 4 and the age (min) set to 1.

On the other hand if a video is about "color" for students to explain to them that every color are in fact electromagnetic waves with different wave lengths, the Age (max) would probably be 150 and Age (min) around 15.

### Age (max)

This is the maximum age for which the learning object would be useful in general. It is usually combined with Age (min) to set the lower age threshold.

For example if a YouTube video is about "color" for helping toddlers learn the name of the color, age (max) would probably set to 4 and the age (min) set to 1.

On the other hand if a video is about "color" for students to explain to them that every color are in fact electromagnetic waves with different wave lengths, the Age (max) would probably be 150 and Age (min) around 15.
