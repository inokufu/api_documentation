# Provider

This is the provider (host) of the Learning object such as youtube, coursera, applebooks, etc.\
You can create any provider you want or select the major providers.\
\
Please note that the **provider** is where the learning object is hosted. It must not be mistaken with the **publisher** which is the organization that produced/funded the learning object. The **author** is a person who contributed to make the learning object.\
\
So for example if we have a MOOC from Coursera with professor X from Stanford, then we would have:\
\- **provider** is coursera\
\- **publisher** is stanford\
\- **author** is professor X\
\
On the other hand, if the learning object is an article hosted on stanford website by professor Y, then we would have\
\- **provider** is stanford\
\- **publisher** is stanford\
\- **author** is professor Y
